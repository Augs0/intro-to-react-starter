This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites
- Javascript (ideally understanding of ES6 but we can work it out as we go if it's new to you)
- Node installed on your machine- we need to use NPM to handle our scripts so you can build and see our social card

## What we will build

A simple social card that shows you how:

- React projects are structured
- to handle event listeners
- to style elements in React
- to handle props
- to handle state 

## Why a social card?

Many sites that use React are a collection of cards, whether that's posts on social media, cards with infromation about a product in a catalogue, or information displayed in a card format e.g. weather app. Learning to build cards can be a helpful first step into building bigger apps~

### Happy coding! 
If you have any questions, let me know :) this will be a whirlwind visit through the basics, but I hope it's helpful
